# Front Door Standard/Premium

This template deploys a Front Door Standard/Premium.

## Sample overview and deployed resources

This sample template creates a Front Door profile, with a single endpoint origin group, origin, and route. To keep the sample simple, Front Door is configured to direct traffic to an Azure Storage static website configured as an origin, but this could be [any origin supported by Front Door](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/frontdoor/standard-premium/concept-origin).

The following resources are deployed as part of the solution:

### Prerequisites
- Azure Storage with a static website, which acts as a simulated origin in this sample.

### Front Door Standard/Premium
- Front Door profile.
  - Note that you can use either the standard or premium Front Door SKU for this sample. By default, the standard SKU is used.
- Front Door endpoint, using the built-in Front Door hostname.
- Front Door origin group.
- Front Door origin. By default, this is configured to send traffic to the Azure Storage static website described above.
- Front door route, to direct traffic to the Azure Storage static website.

## Deployment steps

You can click the "deploy to Azure" button at the beginning of this document or follow the instructions for command line deployment using the scripts in the root of this repo.

## Usage

### Connect

Once you have deployed the Azure Resource Manager template, wait a few minutes before you attempt to access your Front Door endpoint to allow time for Front Door to propagate the settings throughout its network.

You can then access the Front Door endpoint. The hostname is emitted as an output from the deployment - the output is named `frontDoorEndpointHostName`. If you access the base hostname you should see a page saying _Welcome_. If you see a different error page, wait a few minutes and try again.
