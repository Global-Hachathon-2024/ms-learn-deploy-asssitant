- Sending subscription activity logs and Azure resource logs for [all defined sources](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-monitor/essentials/resource-logs-categories?WT.mc_id=Portal-Azure_Marketplace_Datadog).

- Muting the monitor for expected Azure VM Shutdowns. Learn more about Datadog – An Azure Native ISV Service [here](https://aka.ms/ANIS/Datadog/Docs).
