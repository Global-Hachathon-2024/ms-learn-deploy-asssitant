# Deploy API Management in external VNet with public IP

This template shows an example of how to deploy an Azure API Management service within your own virtual network's subnet in [external mode](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/api-management/api-management-using-with-vnet).
In external mode, clients from the internet can connect to the API Management service gateway, while the gateway can access backends available only in the virtual network.

- The template creates a Premium tier API Management instance that is deployed to two availability zones. You may choose to deploy the API Management instance in the Developer tier; however, availability zones are not supported in that tier.
- The template deploys a virtual network and a dedicated subnet that hosts the API Management service.
- The template obtains a Standard SKU public IP address from the customer's subscription.
- The template also deploys a network security group on the API Management subnet, which is based on [recommended configurations](https://aka.ms/apim-vnet-common-issues).
- The template disables all unsecure ciphers and SSL/TLS protocols.
