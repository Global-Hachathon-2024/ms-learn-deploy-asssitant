# Creates a two Container App with a Container App Environment

This template shows how to run the classic Azure Vote sample app as a **Container App** in a **Container App Environment**. This service is still in **Preview**.

The Azure Vote sample app is a 2 container application. This sample shows how to run two containers in the same Container App.
- The front end container is written in python [[repo](https://github.com/Azure-Samples/azure-voting-app-redis)]
- The back end is a standard Redis container image
