# Create Premium Redis Cache with data persistence

Create and configre persistence in premium Redis Cache using a template. Redis persistence enables you to take snapshots and back up the data which you can load in case of a hardware failure. This is a huge advantage over Basic or Standard tier where all the data is stored in memory and there can be potential data loss in case of a failure where Cache nodes are down.

For information about using this template, see [How to configure data persistence for a Premium Azure Redis Cache](https://azure.microsoft.com/documentation/articles/cache-how-to-premium-persistence/).
