# Web App on Linux with Azure database for MySQL

This template provides a way to deploy **Web App and MySQL app** in Azure App Service on Linux. The hosting plan is settled for Consumption. As a default, this template deploys the web app using the S1 free tier as the pricing tier for the hosting plan. It's ideal for development and test environments, for production environments you must consider different plans. For more information about hosting plans, see [App Service pricing](https://azure.microsoft.com/pricing/details/app-service/linux/).
