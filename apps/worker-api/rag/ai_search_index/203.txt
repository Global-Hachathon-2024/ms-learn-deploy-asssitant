# Deploy the MedTech service including an Azure IoT Hub

## Overview

> [!NOTE]
> [Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources (FHIR®)](https://www.hl7.org/fhir/) is an open healthcare specification.

This template deploys the MedTech service with the required resources and access permissions and includes an Azure IoT Hub for device creation/management and device message routing. Conforming and valid device and FHIR destination mappings are also included.

* To learn about this Azure Resource Manager (ARM) template, the resources deployed, and the configured access permissions, see [Receive device messages through Azure IoT Hub](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/healthcare-apis/iot/device-messages-through-iot-hub).

* To learn about the MedTech service, see [What is MedTech service?](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/healthcare-apis/iot/overview)

* To learn about the MedTech service device data processing stages, see [Overview of the MedTech service device data processing stages](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/healthcare-apis/iot/overview-of-device-data-processing-stages).

* To learn how to use the MedTech service Mapping debugger, see [How to use the MedTech service Mapping debugger](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/healthcare-apis/iot/how-to-use-mapping-debugger).

* For an overview of the MedTech service device mapping, see [Overview of the MedTech service device mapping](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/healthcare-apis/iot/overview-of-device-mapping).

* To learn about IotJsonPathContent mappings, see [How to use IotJsonPathContent mappings](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/healthcare-apis/iot/how-to-use-iotjsonpathcontent-mappings).
