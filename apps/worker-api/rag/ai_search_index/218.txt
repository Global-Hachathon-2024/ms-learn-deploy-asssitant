# Deploy Azure Data Explorer db with Event Grid connection

This template allows you deploy a cluster with System Assigned Identity, a database, an Azure Storage Account, an Event hub, an Event Grid notification publishing notifications to Event Hubs and a data connection between the Azure Storage and the database (using the system assigned identity).

This template was authored in bicep (see [bicep template](main.bicep)), referring a [KQL script](script.kql) and then transpiled into [JSON template](azuredeploy.json).

Once the template is deployed, you should be able to copy a CSV text file into the `landing` container and it should be ingested automatically (through the Event Grid connection) in the table `People`.  You can try with a CSV of the form:

```
Name, Department
Alice,Finance
Bob,HR
Carl,Operations
```
