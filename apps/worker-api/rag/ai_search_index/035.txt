# Create a Linux VM from a gallery image on Azure Stack HCI

This template allows you to deploy a new Linux Virtual Machine on an on-premises Azure Stack HCI cluster running 23H2 or newer using the referenced custom image. Follow the [Ubuntu image creation process](/azure-stack/hci/manage/virtual-machine-image-linux-sysprep) to build the custom image then see [Arc VM creation process](/azure-stack/hci/manage/create-arc-virtual-machines) for additional details.

## Prerequisites

In order to deploy this template, there must be an operational ARC Resource Bridge associated with your Azure Stack HCI cluster. The Azure Stack HCI 23H2 and later deployment process will configure the Resource Bridge for you, but you will need to have manually created the Logical Network and Image.

- Custom Location: This is the custom location resource representing your Azure Stack HCI Cluster in Azure. The following Logical Network and Image resources must be associated with this custom location.
- Azure Stack HCI Logical Network: This resource is the Azure representation of your Hyper-v virtual switch and related network configuration used for the Network Interface created for the new VM. See [Azure Stack HCI Logical Networks](/azure-stack/hci/manage/create-logical-networks)
- Azure Stack HCI Image: This is a virtual machine image, created from a custom image. See the [Ubuntu image creation process](/azure-stack/hci/manage/virtual-machine-image-linux-sysprep) for more details.

> [!NOTE]
> For simplicity, this template assumes the Custom Location, Logical Network, and Image all reside in the same Resource Group as where the Virtual Machine is being created.
