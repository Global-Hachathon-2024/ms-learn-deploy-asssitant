# Enable NSG Flow Logs

This template deploys an **NSG flow logs resource** inside the Network Watcher resource group.

## Overview

This template enables a new NSG flow logs resource type `Microsoft.Network/networkWatchers/flowLogs`. To learn more about how to deploy the template, see the [quickstart](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/network-watcher/quickstart-configure-network-security-group-flow-logs-from-arm-template) article.

The flow logs resource is enabled in the (hidden) NetworkWatcherRG resource group that contains the Network Watcher service and related resources. The logs are written to a storage account which is also deployed by the template.

## Prerequisites

Network Watcher must be enabled for your subscription. Network Watcher is enabled by default, so unless you have disabled it, this should not be an issue.
