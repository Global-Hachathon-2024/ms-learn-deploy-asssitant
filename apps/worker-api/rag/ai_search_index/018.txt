# Creates a Dapr pub-sub servicebus app using Container Apps

This template shows how to deploy a Dapr pub-sub servicebus application as a **Container App** in a **Container App Environment**. 

The application deploys the Dapr application used in this [Azure sample template](https://github.com/Azure-Samples/pubsub-dapr-nodejs-servicebus). The template itself is optimised for Developers using the [Azure Developer CLI](https://github.com/Azure/azure-dev), whereas this quickstart is more focussed on the container build and Infrastructure deployment as a single deployment unit.

See the [Dapr Container App](https://github.com/Azure/bicep-registry-modules/blob/main/modules/app/dapr-containerapp/README.md) module in the Bicep Registry for more information.

If you're new to **Dapr**, see:

If you're new to **Container App**, see:
