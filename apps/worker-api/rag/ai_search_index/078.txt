# 101-1vm-2nics-2subnets-1vnet

This template creates a new VM with two NICs which connect to two different subnets within the same VNet.

## Tips

1. If running under PowerShell you may update the **azuredeploy.parameters** file with the **allowedValues** for the subnet name of the Primary NIC and Secondary NIC for a nice dropdown list.
2. Customize parameters in **azuredeploy.parameters** as you see appropriate, at the very least the **adminPassword**.

Feel free to post questions and enjoy!
