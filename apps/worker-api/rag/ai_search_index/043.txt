# Create a Premium Redis Cache with clustering

Create and configure clustering in premium Azure Redis Cache by using a template. Clustering provides the ability to automatically split your dataset among multiple nodes, the ability to continue operations when a subset of the nodes are experiencing failures or are unable to communicate with the rest of the cluster, more throughput, and more memory size.

This template does not include Virtual Network support, but both clustering and Virtual Network support is available in the template [Create Premium Redis Cache with Virtual Network and clustering](https://azure.microsoft.com/documentation/templates/201-redis-premium-vnet-cluster-diagnostics/).

For information about using this template, see [How to configure Redis clustering for a Premium Azure Redis Cache](https://azure.microsoft.com/documentation/articles/cache-how-to-premium-clustering/).
