# Create a Kubernetes cluster on Azure Stack HCI

This template creates an Azure Kubernetes Services provisioned cluster on an on-premises Azure Stack HCI cluster running 23H2 or later. The [article](/azure-stack/hci/manage/manage-virtual-machines-in-azure-portal?tabs=arm) walks you through the process and prerequisites.

## Prerequisites

In order to deploy this template, there must be an operational Arc Resource Bridge associated with your Azure Stack HCI cluster. The Azure Stack HCI 23H2 and later deployment process will configure the Resource Bridge for you, but you will need to have manually created the Logical Network.

- Custom Location: This is the custom location resource representing your Azure Stack HCI Cluster in Azure. The following Virtual Network and Image resources must be associated with this custom location.
- Azure Stack HCI Logical Network: This resource is the Azure representation of your Hyper-v virtual switch and related network configuration used for the Network Interface created for the new VM. See [Azure Stack HCI Virtual Networks](/azure-stack/hci/manage/create-logical-networks)

> [!NOTE]
> For simplicity, this template assumes the Custom Location and Logical Network reside in the same Resource Group as where the Virtual Machine is being created.
