# Push a certificate onto a Windows VM

Push a certificate onto a VM. Pass in the URL of the secret in Key Vault.  The url must be a secret, not a certificate or key.

Use <a href="https://gist.github.com/bmoore-msft/425b79b7b7e226264554ec534b956a48">this script to create a new cert and put it into the vault.  The script can be easily modified to work with an existing cert.
