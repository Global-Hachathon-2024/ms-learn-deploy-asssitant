# Create a data share from a storage account

When you deploy this Azure Resource Manager template, it creates a storage account, and a data share from the storage account. For more details, see [Roles and requirements for Azure Data Share](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/data-share/concepts-roles-permissions#roles-and-requirements).

To learn more about how to deploy the template, see the [quickstart](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/data-share/share-your-data-arm) article.
