# Copy FTP files to Azure Blob logic app

This template allows you to create a Logic app that listens to a folder on an FTP server and will copy it to an Azure Blob container. You can add an additional triggers or actions to customize it to your needs.

Azure Logic Apps is a cloud service that automates the execution of your business processes. You use a graphical design tool called the Logic Apps Designer to arrange pre-made components into the sequence you need. The Designer sends a definition of your workflow to the Logic Apps execution engine. The execution engine launches your app when conditions are right and manages the compute resources needed to run it.
