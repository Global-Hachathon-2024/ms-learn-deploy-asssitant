# Create a cross-region load balancer

This template creates a:

* Two regional load balancers in regions of your choosing

* [Cross-region load balancer](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/load-balancer/cross-region-overview) in a region of your choosing

The template creates supporting public IP resources, virtual networks, and bastion hosts for management in each region.

Three Windows Server virtual machines are deployed in each region. The virtual machines are members of the backend pool of each regional load balancer.

IIS is installed with an extension. The default web page is replaced with a page displaying the computer name.

The regional load balancer front-ends are added as a member of the backend pool of the cross-region load balancer.
