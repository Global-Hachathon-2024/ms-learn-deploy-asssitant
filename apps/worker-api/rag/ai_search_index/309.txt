# Create Azure Notification Hub

This template creates a Notification Hub on Azure. To learn more about how to deploy the template, see the [quickstart](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/notification-hubs/create-notification-hub-template) article.

Azure Notification Hubs is a massively scalable mobile push notification engine for quickly sending millions of notifications to iOS, Android, Windows, or Kindle devices, working with APNs (Apple Push Notification service), GCM (Google Cloud Messaging), WNS (Windows Push Notification Service), MPNS (Microsoft Push Notification Service), and more. Tailor your notifications to specific customers—or entire audiences—with just a few lines of code, and do it across any platform.

Tutorials, API references, and other documentation show you how to set up and send push notifications from any backend to any mobile device.
