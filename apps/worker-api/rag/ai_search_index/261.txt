# Azure DNS Private Resolver

This template will deploy **Azure DNS Private resolver** with required resources such as Virtual Network, subnets (for Inbound and Outbound endpoints), DNS private resolver endpoints, forwarding rulesets, and forwarding rules. It deploys the private resolver and the virtual network in the same location mentioned in the parameter.

# Overview and deployed resources

A virtual network is deployed with two subnets that will be used for resolver's inbound and outbound endpoint. The dns resolver resource is then deployed in this virtual network along with inbound, outbound endpoints, forwarding ruleset and forwarding rules with target DNS servers. The ruleset will be linked to the outbound endpoint for conditional forwarding.
