# Azure Traffic Manager external endpoint example

This template shows how to create an Azure Traffic Manager profile using external endpoints and the performance traffic routing method. To enable performance-based traffic routing, each endpoint needs an `endpointLocation` that specifies the closest Azure region. To learn more about how to deploy the template, see the [quickstart](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/traffic-manager/quickstart-create-traffic-manager-profile-template) article.

The accompanying PowerShell script shows how to create a resource group from the template and read back the Traffic Manager profile details.
