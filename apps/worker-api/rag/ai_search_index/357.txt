# Function App

This template deploys an empty **Function App**. Azure Functions is a serverless compute service that lets you run event-triggered code without having to explicitly provision or manage infrastructure.
With a **Function App** you also deploy a Web Hosting Plan. The Web Plan is charged by Consumption. For more information about Hosting Plans click [here!](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/azure-functions/functions-scale)

If you are new to Function Apps, see:

- [Azure Function Documentation](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/azure-functions/)
- [Template reference](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/templates/microsoft.compute/allversions)

If you are new to template deployment, see:

[Azure Resource Manager documentation](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/azure-resource-manager/)
