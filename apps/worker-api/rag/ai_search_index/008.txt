# Create a multiregion Premium tier API Management instance

This template demonstrates how to create a Premium tier API Management instance with additional locations.

Make sure that the location of the resource group is not same as one of the additional Locations.
- The template deploys 3 units of the Premium tier. Consider the cost before deploying the template.
- The template disables all unsecure SSL/TLS protocols and ciphers.
- The template also restricts control plane calls to not expose secrets to users with read-only permission on the API Management instances.
- The template exposes a property `disableGateway` on the API Management instance which can be used to remove a region out of gateway rotation.
