Azure functions is a solution for easily running small pieces of code, or "functions," in the cloud. You can write just the code you need for the problem at hand, without worrying about a whole application or the infrastructure to run it. For more information about Azure Functions, see the [Azure Functions Overview](https://azure.microsoft.com/documentation/articles/functions-overview/).
