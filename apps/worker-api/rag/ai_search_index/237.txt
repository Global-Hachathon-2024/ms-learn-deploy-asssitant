# Azure AI Studio Network Restricted

This set of templates demonstrates how to set up Azure AI Studio with a network-restricted configuration, meaning with public internet access disabled and egress disabled. It uses Microsoft-managed keys for encryption and Microsoft-managed identity configuration for the Azure ML resource. Customization is required to create rules for the managed outbound access, and setup does not include additional rules to facilitate traffic access to the managed VNet. This template works as-is.

## Limitations

Limitations are maintained and kept up-to-date [here](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/ai-studio/how-to/configure-private-link?source=recommendations&tabs=azure-portal#limitations):

* You might encounter problems trying to access the private endpoint for your workspace if you're using Mozilla Firefox. This problem might be related to DNS over HTTPS in Mozilla Firefox. We recommend using Microsoft Edge or Google Chrome.

## Pre-requisites

This template expects that you have private VNet setup for your organization, and that you have traffic patterns established to access it securely. You must have access to creating private endpoints for the VNet setup you wish to connect.

## Resources
