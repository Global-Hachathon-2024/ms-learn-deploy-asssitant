# Virtual Network NAT

This template deploys a **NAT gateway** and virtual network with a single subnet and public IP resource for the NAT gateway.

## Overview and deployed resources

This template is a resource manager implementation of a quickstart for deploying a NAT gateway.  A virtual network is deployed with a single subnet. The NAT gateway resource is associated with this subnet. A single public IP resource is created for the NAT gateway.

For more information on **Virtual Network NAT** service and **NAT gateway** see:

* [What is Virtual Network NAT?](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/virtual-network/nat-overview)

* [Designing virtual networks with NAT gateway resources](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/virtual-network/nat-gateway-resource)

The following resources are deployed as part of the solution

### Microsoft.Network

Description

+ **publicIPAddresses**: Public IP address for NAT gateway.
+ **natGateways**: NAT gateway resource
+ **virtualNetworks**: Virtual network for NAT gateway.
  + **subnets**: Subnet for virtual network for NAT gateway.
