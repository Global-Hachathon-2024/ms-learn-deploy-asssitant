# Redis Enterprise with Vector DB

Create an Azure Cache for Redis instance with `Redis Search` module installed on it. Redis Search module allows you to use Redis Cache as a vector DB where user can store embeddings, create indexes and then query the embeddings using vector search, semantic search and hybrid search. Currently, only Azure Redis Enterprise supports the `Redis Search` module. This template will provision an Enterprise Azure Cache for Redis along with Redis search module installed on top of it.

For information about using this template, see [Create an Azure Cache for Redis using an ARM template](https://azure.microsoft.com/documentation/articles/cache-redis-cache-arm-provision/).
