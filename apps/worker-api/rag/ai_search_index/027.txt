# Create a Attestation provider

This template creates an Attestation provider.

## Overview

Microsoft Azure Attestation (MAA) is a new solution for attesting Trusted Execution Environments (TEEs) such as Software Guard Extensions (SGX) enclaves and Virtualization-based Security (VBS) enclaves. Enclave attestation is a process for verifying that an enclave is secure and trustworthy.

This template demonstrates a simple use case for creating an Attestation provider. For more information see [Quickstart: Create an Azure Attestation provider with an ARM template](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/attestation/quickstart-template).
