# Web App with VNet Injection and Private Endpoint

This template deploys a secure front end - back end web app. The web app 2 (front end web app) is plugged in a subnet with the feature regional VNet integration, settings are set to consume a DNS private zone, the web app 1 is the back end web app, only exposed through a private endpoint.
It will create a VNet, two subnets, one where your Private Endpoint will exist, the second where you will inject the front web app, an App Service Plan in PremiumV2 tier (mandatory for Private Endpoint), a Private Endpoint, settings for DNS queries to the DNS Private Zone, and a private DNS zone with record for the Private Endpoint.
