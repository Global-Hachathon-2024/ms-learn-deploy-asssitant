# Virtual Network NAT with VM

This template deploys a **NAT gateway** and supporting resources.

## Overview

This template is a resource manager implementation of a quickstart for deploying a NAT gateway. An Ubuntu virtual machine is deployed to the subnet that is associated with the NAT gateway. To learn more about how to deploy the template, see the [quickstart](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/virtual-network/quickstart-create-nat-gateway-template) article.

For more information on **Virtual Network NAT** service and **NAT gateway** see:

- [What is Virtual Network NAT?](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/virtual-network/nat-overview)
- [Designing virtual networks with NAT gateway resources](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/virtual-network/nat-gateway-resource)

## Deployed resources

The following resources are deployed as part of the solution.

### Microsoft.Network

- **networkingSecurityGroups**: Network security group for virtual machine.
  - **securityrules**: NSG rule to open port 22 to virtual machine.
- **publicIPAddresses**: Public IP address for NAT gateway and virtual machine.
- **publicIPPrefixes**: Public IP prefix for NAT gateway.
- **natGateways**: NAT gateway resource.
- **virtualNetworks**: Virtual network for NAT gateway and virtual machine.
  - **subnets**: Subnet for virtual network for NAT gateway and virtual machine.
